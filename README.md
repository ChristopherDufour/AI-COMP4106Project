# AI-COMP4106Project
This is my final project for Carleton University's AI program

Please see the project report for more information.

The program was coded in Eclipse and on Windows 7, and has not been thoroughly tested on other platforms. The program is command line based and has no graphical user interface beyond that.

How to run the program:
1.	Switch Eclipseâ€™s workspace in to the folder where the project files are located. If it does not appear go to File->Import->Existing projects into workspace and import it.
2.	Press Run
3.	Follow the instructions in the command prompt.
